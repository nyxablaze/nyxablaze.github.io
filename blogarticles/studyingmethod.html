<h1> How I study </h1>
<p>
<h2>note-taking</h2>
my dominant method for studying is reconsolidating all the work i do in a week, by retaking notes. my method for taking notes is by writing/annotating on the lecture slides during the lecture using my Surface Book 2, then later writing all the notes, including annotations, up in a text document (namely EMACS since Semester 2 2023).
<br>i find this helps me remember the content really well and ensures I don't forget anything, and I usually do all of this as early in the week as possible so I stay ahead for most of my units.
<h2>studying content</h2>
<p>
to study and revise content after i have watched the relevant lectures and notetaken them on both the lecture slides and in the text editor, i use a combination of self-sourced resources and university provided resources.
<em><h3>self-sourced resources</h3></em>
self-sourced resources are usually things like made up questions, flash cards/memory games (quizlet used to be good for this but now they have a subscription program..?? if anyone can reccomend a different program now pls hit me up on my email <a href='mailto:nyxablaze@gmail.com' target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nyxablaze@gmail.com</a>, i don't wanna pay for quizlet lol)
<em><h3>university provided resourced</h3></em>
university provided resources are resources such as workshop sets and practicals (problem sets to be done both in and out of class), quizzes that don't contribute to my grade, and other any other resource that can be attempted multiple times and don't contribute to my grades or have a due date. although entirely optional, these, i find, are extremely useful in creating strong neural links both intrasubject and intersubject(s).
<br>
<h2>extra work planning</h2>
completing extra work that's not graded, not assigned and sometimes, not even handed in, is a method i'm going to be trying for the first time this semester. this includes writing extra essays and getting them graded by unit co-ordinators or lab demonstrators, writing extra questions in practicals and workshop sets to test my knowledge to an extensive level, and creating "tests" bi-weekly to complete as a form of identifying my weaknesses so i know what needs more work. i will write another blog article on it if i find it's going well, or i'll just continue adding information to this article.
<br>
<br>
<h2>time spent studying</h2>
i try to spend at least 4 hours a day doing work, whether that work is assigned or not, or if it's studying and revising. ideally, at least once a week i will spend 8 hours working, where i spend 2 hours on each unit i have. within those 2 hours will be 1 hour completing assigned work, and 1 hour completing study/non-assigned work. if i finish all assigned work early, then i just work on non-assigned work for the remainder of the 2 hours. during other days, i spend 1 hour minimum on each subject, with no particular split on assigned work and non-assigned work, i just do as much as i can with the time i find during the day.
<br>
having to work casually as well takes up some time in my week, and i would much rather spend this time studying however that's just not feasible if i want money to fund other parts of my life, such as social events and hobbies. hopefully, i can get some sort of scholarship/stipend that allows me to work much less during the semester, so i can spend more time studying and achieve higher grades.
<br>
<h2>self-care</h2>
i want to end the blog by reminding anyone reading this of the importance of self-care in order to not burn out. you won't be valuable if you're so burnt out you are not able to work. personally, self-care for me is taking time to exercise at the gym, which has been tough to find the time to do recently but after managing my timetable a bit better this week i should be able to find more time to go to the gym. self-care for me also includes spending time alone reading, or if i feel i have been productive enough in the last few days, i might watch some youtube videos provided they are high-quality and intellectually stimulating.
<br>
how much self-care you need, and in what form, is entirely dependant on individual differences. what works for me might not work for you, so spend some time working on yourself and figuring out what works best for you to keep yourself irom burning out.
