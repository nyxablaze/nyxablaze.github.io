<h1> How I study </h1>
<p>
my dominant method for studying is reconsolidating all the work i do in a week, by retaking notes. my method for taking notes is by writing/annotating on the lecture slides during the lecture using my Surface Book 2, then later writing all the notes, including annotations, up in a text document (namely EMACS since Semester 2 2023).
<br>i find this helps me remember the content really well and ensures I don't forget anything, and I usually do all of this as early in the week as possible so I stay ahead for most of my units.
