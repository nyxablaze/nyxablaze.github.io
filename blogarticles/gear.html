  <h1>EDC</h1>
  <p>my everyday carry is not necessarily the lightest carry - i tend to make sure i have absolutely everything i need. however i don't mind the weight, and using a messenger bag means there's only so much i can carry anyway giving me a weight constraint to make sure that no matter how much i put in the bag, it is not a struggle to carry around.
    <br>
    i do need to be mindful, as for the next few months i will be riding my bike to the train station. while not far at all, only about a kilometre, the weight of my bag can be an issue if the bag isn't balanced on my back. if, for example, the bag slips around to my side, i can throw my weight balance of a little bit but honestly it's not that hard to compensate for.
