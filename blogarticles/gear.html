  <p>my everyday carry is not necessarily the lightest carry - i tend to make sure i have absolutely everything i need, and further more my laptop is 1.7kg so not exactly light. however i don't mind the weight, and using a messenger bag means there's only so much i can carry anyway giving me a weight constraint to make sure that no matter how much i put in the bag, it is not a struggle to carry around.
