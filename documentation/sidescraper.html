        <h2> HOW IT WORKS </h2>
        <div>
            Basically, this program, nicknamed sidescraper, is a HTML frontend (what you see) with a python based backend (where all the work is done, a.k.a an API). The frontend contains the forms with make, model, year, variant and bodytype.<br>
            When you input your data and hit 'submit', it gets sent to the API. This API then uses these data fields to literally just construct the URL of the carsales page for the car you're looking for. e.g.:<br>
            &#x2022 model: honda<br>
            &#x2022 make: civic<br>
            &#x2022 year: 2018<br>
            &#x2022 variant: vti-l<br>
            &#x2022 bodytype: hatchback<br>
            constructs the url: https://www.carsales.com.au/honda/civic/price/2018/vti-l-<br>
            what you may notice though is that 1. the website has the 'price' in the URL, the URL has a '-' on the end of the variant, and 3 the URL isn't complete. there are two types of 2018 vti-l's, the sedan and the hatchabck, this is where the bodytype parameter is used.<br>
            using the constructed URL so far, the API looks for all urls leading off of this one, and in this case there is two:<br>
            &#x2022 https://www.carsales.com.au/honda/civic/price/2018/vti-l-479753/<br>
            and<br>
            &#x2022 https://www.carsales.com.au/honda/civic/price/2018/vti-l-479759/<br>
            these differ by two numbers and don't explictly state the body type. However, you can see why the dash is added after the variant, because otherwise its ambiguous if the user was referring to the vti-l or vti-lx, which has it's own set of URLs.<br>
            the next step is for the API to open this URL, and look through it. If it doesn't find the right bodytype, it loops to the next URL. When the bodytype is found, the loop breaks, and the URL that broke the loop is used. In this case, the bodytype hatchback found in the site https://www.carsales.com.au/honda/civic/price/2018/vti-l-479753/, under "Body: Hatch". my code takes care of the difference between Hatchback and Hatch.<br>
            Next, the successful URL is downloaded to the backend. The locally stored URL is then opened by the API, and the price data and image are extracted from this, and displayed back to you on the frontend.<br>
            That's it<br><br><br>
            <h1>IMPROVEMENTS POSSIBLE</h1>
            &#x2022 The website could be improved to show an error code when there is no matches. This is in the works, but for some reason in testing this simple add breaks everything. I'll get there. <b><em>- UPDATE - this has been added and works fine (at least it seems to be)</em></b><br>
            &#x2022 The API could be improved to be able to handle more than one car at a time, and return a list of cars, rather than just one.<br>
            &#x2022 The API could be improved to show the name of the car that's been extracted, this would be easy but after this project is done I don't see the point as it's not going to be used much. If it is for some reason, I'll add it<br>
            &#x2022 The API could be configured to also seach for data about the Transmission (manual or auto or CVT) using a dropdown, and the engine (4Cyl, Diesel, Petrol, engine size etc) as well, but again, this is more work than is worth for a small project like this. <br>
            &#x2022 A bit more farfetched, and only worth it if this project is going to be used a lot, but the API could be configured to use machine-learning to iron out user errors such as spelling mistakes or formatting errors. too much work, too small a project. <br><br><br><br><br>
            <h1>USAGE TIPS</h1>
            &#x2022 Insert the right spelling exactly for all fields<br>
            &#x2022 For Variant: Include dashes in cars where it's part of the name ('v-ti' not 'vti', 'mx-5' not 'mx5'). Spaces will be converted to dashes, but usually the user doesn't need to worry about this. e.g. 'type r' will fetch the correct car<br>
            &#x2022 User be aware: not all cars will have photos, and not all car types (transmission differences etc) will be represented by this tool<br>
            &#x2022 For cars without a badge (Mazda3 2003 sedan has no badge), leave variant blank and no-badge will be assumed.<br>
            &#x2022 if you do not know the variant, <b> don't leave it blank. </b> rather, write 'any' and the price range for all variants, from the cheapest to the most expensive, will be shown as one block.<br>
            &#x2022 some cars have only one bodytype, in this instance, bodytype can be left blank. if left blank when there are multiple types, the first type listed on carsales URL directory will be assumed.<br>
                - > e.g. Audi TT 2013 has both coupe and convertible, and a no-badge and an 's' variant.<br>
                - > here, if variant is left blank, the no-badge version will be shown and if variant is 's', the tts model will be shown<br>
                - > if bodytype is specified, the correct version will be displayed. if blank, the first one (convertible in this instance) will be displayed.<br>

            <h2>Update: 03/02/2024 @ 1017 AWST</h2>
            <h3>Last night I added logging into the system. To be clear - all this does is log the time of use and the inputs & the outputted car for each use and that's it. No user data, the only things that will be recorded are the things written into the form. This is mainly for my own curiosity, to see how often the tool gets used, and to see what kind of cars have been searched on here.</h3>
